<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If you're craving a quick and delicious Asian-inspired dish, fried rice is a go-to option. This fried rice recipe combines fluffy rice with a medley of colorful vegetables, protein of your choice, and savory seasonings, all stir-fried to perfection. Whether you opt for chicken, shrimp, or tofu, this versatile dish can be customized to your taste. To begin, start by cooking your choice of protein and setting it aside. In the same pan, stir-fry a mixture of diced vegetables, such as bell peppers, carrots, and peas, in a flavorful blend of garlic, ginger, and soy sauce. Add cooked and cooled rice to the pan, along with the cooked protein. Stir everything together until well combined, and let it cook until the rice gets slightly crispy. Finish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkle of green onions for that extra burst of flavor. Serve your homemade fried rice as a satisfying main course or as a tasty side dish!</p>
