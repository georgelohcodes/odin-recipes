    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're looking for a hearty and delicious meal that's perfect for gatherings or family dinners, you can't go wrong with classic lasagna. This Italian favorite is a layered dish of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and gooey cheese, all baked to perfection. To make a mouthwatering lasagna, start by boiling lasagna noodles until they're al dente. While they cook, prepare a flavorful meat sauce by browning ground beef with onions and garlic, then adding crushed tomatoes, herbs, and spices. In a separate saucepan, create a creamy béchamel sauce by melting butter, whisking in flour, and adding milk until thickened. Now, it's time to assemble. Begin with a layer of meat sauce, followed by noodles, béchamel, and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until your dish is filled. Bake in the oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, and your lasagna is ready to be enjoyed by all!</p>
